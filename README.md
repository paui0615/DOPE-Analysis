# Outline
This project uses DOP-E method, which is an open source code that estimates Rayleigh wave properties and constructs underground velocity structures, to perform data analysis on the mountainous area of ​​Kaohsiung City in Taiwan.
This project uses python for data processing and analysis, and the package "matplotlib" is utilized for data visualization. Through these analyses, we have a breakthrough understanding of Rayleigh wave characteristics in the Chulin landslide area of ​​Taiwan, which will be helpful for future landslide remediation and prevention.
