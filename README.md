# Outline
### This project uses [DOP-E method](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/216/3/1817/5222650), which is an open source code on [Github](https://github.com/berbellini/DOP-E) that estimates Rayleigh wave properties and constructs underground velocity structures, to perform data analysis on the mountainous area of ​​Kaohsiung City in Taiwan.
### This project uses python for data processing and analysis, and the package "matplotlib" is utilized for data visualization. Through these analyses, we have a breakthrough understanding of Rayleigh wave characteristics in the Chulin landslide area of ​​Taiwan, which will be helpful for future landslide remediation and prevention.
